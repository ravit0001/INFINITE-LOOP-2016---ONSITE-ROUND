#PROBLEM:
Find the number of ways of selecting one or more items from N distinct things.


#EXPLANATION:
So, Number of ways of selecting one or more items from N distinct things.

nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + nC3 + ------------- + nCn = $2^n$

nC1 + -----------------nCn =$2^n$ - nC0

= $2^n$ – 1     , [ nC0=1] 


FOR example,
you need to find number of ways of selecting one or more items from 5 distinct things.
so,  

 5C0 + 5C1 + 5C2 + 5C3 + 5C4 + 5C5 = $2^5$

5C1 + 5C2 + 5C3 + 5C4 + 5C5 =$2^n$ - 5C0

= $2^5$ – 1=31
